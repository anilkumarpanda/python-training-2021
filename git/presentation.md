Ask participants to share their team and reason for learning GIT

# Why GIT?

- Wide-spread usage. Almost all software projects are developed using GIT
	- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
	- [Python](https://github.com/python)
    - [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- Full history & backup of all changes
- Useful even while working alone.

üëâ Essential skill as data scientist.

---

# Homework

[GIT for humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)

Git has a very steep learning curve.

History: Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History))

---

# Learning goals today

- Basic git workflow
- Working with multiple people via a remote (github or gitlab)
- Fixing merge conflicts
- Branching
- Merge requests
- Using github's features

---

# Windows?

`cmd` or `powershell` wont't cut it. Either:

- Install [Git Bash for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (windows 10)

---

# Show & tell: The basics

- `mkdir projectname && cd projectname`
- `git init` Make the current folder a git repository 
- `git status` See the current status of git. Use it A LOT!
- `git add <file>` Add a file to the staging area
- `git commit` Add the changes in the staging area to a commit üì∏
- `git log` View the list of commits

üëâ Fun commit messages? [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)

<!--

**make sure to show files actually changing**

# Exercise üî®

1. Create a local git repo
1. Add a new file
1. Commit it to git

---

# Solution :camera_flash:

```bash
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README"
```

---

# Using the history

- `git diff <commit>` or `git diff <file>` Compare changes
- `git checkout <commit>` Time travel to a specific commit
- `git checkout <file>` (‚ö†Ô∏è) Removes all edits to a file since the last commit
- `git checkout master` Go back to most current version of the `master` branch
- `git revert <commit>` Undo a commit (creates a new commit)
- `git blame <file>` For each line who wrote it

---

# Working together

We need to send our work to a central location, a single *origin*. This can be gitlab or github or another hosting service.

---

# Show and tell: projects on github

On github.com:

- [Navigate to this training repo](https://github.com/orchardbirds/github_training_2021)
- Add SSH keys

<!-- 
Using remotes it important, it's also backup

gitlab just like github and others, adds more on top of git (like social stuff)
-->

---

# Using github

- `git clone` Downloads the project.
- `git remote -v` shows the URL of the *origin*.
- `git push origin master` Pushes new commits to *origin* from the *master* branch


---

# Exercise üî®

1. Clone our example repo
1. Create a new file called `<yourname>.md`
1. Push it to the origin

<!-- Perhaps let one participant do this live? -->

---

# Viewing our collaboration

- Github's visual commit history (instead of `git log`)
- Github's visual blame (instead of `git blame`)

---

# Show and tell: Merge conflicts

What if you edit the same line? Let's try:

- (trainer) change, add and commit a line in a file
- (volunteer) change, add and commit same line
- (volunteer) push code to origin
- (trainer) push code to origin ‚ùóÔ∏èconflict ‚ùóÔ∏è

To solve, edit the files manually.


---

# Exercise üî®

1. Make pairs
1. Agree on editing the same line in one of your `<yourname>.md` files
1. Let one person push first, and the second shares his/her screen
1. Solve the merge conflict together

<!-- If possible, do this in break-out rooms -->

---

# Branches

What if your changes break work? Work on a copy of the code using *branches*.

- `git checkout -b somethingnew` Create a new branch
- `git branch` Overview of the branches in the repository
- `git checkout master` Go to the *master* branch
- `git checkout <branch name>` Go to the <branch name> branch
- `git merge <branch name>` Merge commits from <branch name> into the current branch 
- `git branch -d <branch name>` Delete the branch


<!--
- Explain this is useful even when working locally alone, for quick experiment
- Show files on disk changing live when switching branches
- Merging, show on the mental model. Explain 'from' and 'into' logic, by updating drawing on board
-->

---

# Exercise üî®

1. Make a new local branch and create a first commit
1. Switch to the master branch and create a second commit
1. Merge the two branches so everything is in the master branch

<!-- If possible, do this in break-out rooms -->

---

# Show & tell: Github UI

- Navigation
- Starring projects
- Files, commits
- File history
- Git blame
- Statistics
- Github issues & closing through a commit message

üöö Note: ING is moving to Azure DevOps and decommissioning gitlab this year

---

# Show & tell: Using remote branches

- Create a branch using the github UI or,
- Push a branch using `git checkout -b branchname` and `git push origin branchname`

<!--
Before showing MR show how to use branches
-->

---

# üí™ Pull Requests !

- Pull requests -> New pull request
    - With commit message, when merged, closes linked issue
- Very powerful, especially when using web IDE for quick edits

<!-- Demo, obvsly -->
<!-- Also show what happens if you create a MR for an issue twice -->

---

# Exercise üî®

1. Create a specific issue for yourself
1. Create a branch
1. Push to this branch
1. Create a pull request (PR) for it
1. Checkout the branch for your PR locally 
1. Update your `<yourname>.md` file and push
1. Merge your PR

<!--
When everyone is done, make sure to check if we need to cleanup.
Sometimes someone creates two merge requests for 1 issue. If not, do it yourself and show how to cleanup.
-->

---

# Final exercise üî®

In pairs of two. Instructions per person:

- Create your own individual github issue
- Create a branch
- Create a github pull request (PR) for your issue
- Checkout the branch for your PR locally
- Edit a file and push a commit to your branch
   - You can reference your issue in the commit message ("did a thing see #1")
   - Make sure to fix any merge conflicts if they arise
- Next, checkout and push a commit to your teammate's branch
- Finally, have your teammate review (leave some comments?) & approve your PR
- Merge your PR! :tada:

# Finally: Working more efficiently

Gitlab/Github  aliases:

```bash
alias gst='git status'
alias gp='git pull'
alias gc='git commit -m'
alias gaa='git add --all'
alias gl='git log --graph'
alias gpo='git push origin'
alias gpom='git push origin master'
```

---

# Advanced git

- `git commit --amend` Adding to last commit
- `git commit -am "message"` Short for `git add --all` and `git commit -m`. Or with aliases above: `gaa && gc "message"`.
- `git commit -m "message" -m "detailed message"`. Add description.
